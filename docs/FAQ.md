## Will this project replace Windows/MacOS/Linux/... one day?

No. Absolutely not. Because, it's not viable for an operating system
today to just get rid of all backward compatibility with existing software,
simply because what users are interested in applications first, and **then**
the system itself - it's secure, stable, performant, and so on.

Imagine someone introducing the perfect operating system, but with almost
no application on it. Would you get rid of your Windows/MacOS/Linux/... system
for this one? Surely not, at least not as your everyday system.

This is why this project is for now purely *theorical*.

## How can I help?

Help is very welcome but there's not many things to help with currently,
as the system is still being designed. You can still help by suggesting
improvements or fixing an error (whatever it is, a design problem or a simple typo)
by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/lapis-org/docs/issues/new/choose).

# LapisOS
LapisOS is an experimental general-purpose operating system aiming to
provide the highest security and safety to the average user, while
remaining powerful enough to be fast, efficient and highly customizable
for more advanced users.

## Features
- Extreme customization, up to the kernel itself
- Data loss prevention with *crash saves*
- Built-in [parental control](docs/features/parental-control.md)
- ...

## Documentation

Design and specification documents can be found in the [`docs`](docs) directory.

The documentation is also live at [`https://lapis-org.github.io/docs`](https://lapis-org.github.io/docs).

## What is LapisOS?
LapisOS is an operating system aiming to replace ancient systems like Windows,
Linux, MacOS. Well, this is an *ideal* goal but given how much Windows/Linux/MacOS
and other systems are deeply installed in today's computers, LapisOS is more of
a theorical operating system that shows what we could get if we hadn't to maintain
legacy compatibility with ancient architectures.

<p>Welcome to LapisOS' documentation! This book will show you how the
system is designed, how it works, and all the little things it can offer
to the end user as well as the features available for application developers.</p>
<p><strong>Before reading this documentation, please note that</strong> I'm developing this
project on my own and I'm by no mean an operating system expert.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-lapisos"><a class="header" href="#what-is-lapisos">What is LapisOS?</a></h3>
<p>LapisOS is an operating system aiming to replace ancient systems like Windows,
Linux, MacOS. Well, this is an <em>ideal</em> goal but given how much Windows/Linux/MacOS
and other systems are deeply installed in today's computers, LapisOS is more of
a theorical operating system that shows what we could get if we hadn't to maintain
legacy compatibility with ancient architectures.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-projects-structure"><a class="header" href="#whats-the-projects-structure">What's the project's structure?</a></h3>
<p>The project is composed of three distinct parts: the kernel, the system
and the desktop environment.</p>
<p>The first one is the part that allows the software to access the hardware,
like writing files to the disk. It's a microkernel, meaning it's easier to
maintain and has a reduced attack surface for potential security issues
than a monolithic kernel like Linux.</p>
<p>The system is the higher-level component that deals with everything that is
not directly related to hardware or graphical interface. For instance, applications,
user accounts and permissions are all managed by the system.</p>
<p>The desktop environment, finally, is the part the user sees when launching LapisOS.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="conception"><a class="header" href="#conception">Conception</a></h2>
<p>This first part is to write conception documents about how the system works, both at
high-level (native applications, features etc.) and low-level (process management, kernel
design etc.).</p>
<p>This project is currently in this state.</p>
<h2 id="validation"><a class="header" href="#validation">Validation</a></h2>
<p>Once all conception documents are ready, they will be validated one by one,
and frozen. Breaking changes after validation are still possible but should
be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<h2 id="implementation"><a class="header" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Once all documents have been validated, the different pieces can be implemented.</p>
<p>It may be happen that, during implementation, some validated documents get
modifications in order to improve or fix some specific points. Each modification
will need to be validated in order to preserve the stability of these documents.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-unoptimized-kernel"><a class="header" href="#phase-1-unoptimized-kernel">Phase 1: Unoptimized kernel</a></h3>
<p>The first piece to be implemented will be the kernel. This is required as the
kernel is needed in order to implement higher-level pieces like processes.</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-low-level-implementation"><a class="header" href="#phase-2-low-level-implementation">Phase 2: Low-level implementation</a></h3>
<p>Once the unoptimized kernel is ready, two implementations will start in parallel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel optimization</li>
<li>System development</li>
</ul>
<p>The system development will consist in building the following pieces successively:</p>
<ul>
<li>The BIOS/UEFI bootloader</li>
<li>The process manager</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phase-3-applications--system-optimization"><a class="header" href="#phase-3-applications--system-optimization">Phase 3: Applications &amp; System Optimization</a></h3>
<p>The third phase consists in developing the native applications, which are
meant to be used by the end user, as well as optimizing the system in
parallel and improving its stability.</p>
<p>Starting from this point, all conception documents are definitely validated,
which means they cannot receive breaking changes anymore, only few points/features.</p>
<p>This also coincides with the system's <strong>first alpha release</strong>, which will allow persons
who are external to the project to test it and suggest improvements.</p>
<h3 id="phase-4-completion"><a class="header" href="#phase-4-completion">Phase 4: Completion</a></h3>
<p>The last phase's purpose is to ensure the system is in a fully usable state.</p>
<p>The kernel and system will also need to be properly optimized, and once all
these things are done a <strong>first beta release</strong> will be deployed.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-optimization--maintenance"><a class="header" href="#evolution-optimization--maintenance">Evolution, Optimization &amp; Maintenance</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Evolution, Optimization &amp; Maintenance</em> (EPM) part is pretty explicit: it's all
about improving LapisOS' existing features, introducing new ones as needed, improving
performances and stability, and fixing new bugs.</p>
<p>This part will last forever, as for all operating systems.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="languages"><a class="header" href="#languages">Languages</a></h2>
<p>The project will be developed in C, with first-class support for this language.</p>
<p>Usage of architecture-specific Assembly will be reduced as much as possible, being
only used in two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The desired behaviour cannot be reached without Assembly
(e.g. direct register or stack manipulation)</li>
<li>Extremely performance-critical pieces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-applications-work"><a class="header" href="#how-applications-work">How applications work</a></h2>
<p>An application is a set of executable files and resources. They are
only way to execute code, as direct binary programs are not supported.</p>
<p>Any user can install applications, which will only be available from its
account. Administrator users can install global applications, which are
available to every user.</p>
<h2 id="installation-methods"><a class="header" href="#installation-methods">Installation methods</a></h2>
<p>Applications are installed through an <em>application package</em>. There
are several installation methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the store</li>
<li>Directly from the application's package</li>
<li>As a volatile application</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="from-the-store"><a class="header" href="#from-the-store">From the store</a></h3>
<p>Applications can be downloaded from LapisOS' official applications store.</p>
<ul>
<li>For closed-source applications, the store only provides pre-compiled programs</li>
<li>For open-source applications, the store provides both pre-compiled programs as well
as the source code</li>
</ul>
<p>For the later, user can choose either to build the program from source, using the
appropriated build tools in order to optimize performances, or to simply use the
pre-built programs (which is the option by default).</p>
<h3 id="sideloading"><a class="header" href="#sideloading">Sideloading</a></h3>
<p>Applications sideloading (installing an application directly from its <a href="concepts/">package (WIP)</a>)
follows strict rules determined by the <em>sideloading mode</em>, which is either
&quot;disabled&quot;, &quot;secure&quot; or &quot;unsecure&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable mode</strong> prevents all sideloading; it's not possible to install
applications from their package in this mode. <a href="concepts/applications.html#volatile-applications">Volatile applications</a>
can still be run, though.</li>
<li><strong>Secure mode</strong> allows sideloading but will first make the system check
if the application's <a href="concepts/">AID (WIP)</a> matches an existing application on the Store.
If so, it compares the application's signature to the Store application's
store. If they don't match, the application is considered malicious and
won't be installed. Note that this mode only works while connected to 
internet, as the system needs to check the Store to ensure the application
is not malicious. If the computer is offline, sideloading will be
disabled.</li>
<li><strong>Unsecure mode</strong> allows sideloading without any checking, which is
highly dangerous as it allows spoofing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sideloading mode can be changed in the <a href="concepts/">Control Center (WIP)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="volatile-applications"><a class="header" href="#volatile-applications">Volatile applications</a></h3>
<p>Applications can be also be ran as <em>volatile applications</em>, which means
they are not installed on the disk. There are three methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Full-volatile</em>: the app's datas are removed when the application closes</li>
<li><em>Session-scoped</em>: the app's datas are stored on disk until the system shuts down</li>
<li><em>Local-persistent</em>: the app's datas are stored within a data file located in the same folder</li>
<li><em>Persistent</em>: the app's datas are stored in a dedicated folder, also enabling common data between users</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, volatile applications are ran in <em>local-persistent</em> mode. In this mode,
the system first checks if a file with the same name as application's package but with
the <em>.vad (Volatile Application's Data)</em> exists. If so, it opens this file as the application's
storage. Then, when the application wants to store some data, it is stored inside in this data file.</p>
<p>Note that <em>.vad (Volatile Application's Data)</em> files are disguised <a href="concepts/">VSF (WIP)</a> files.</p>
<p>Volatile applications running as persistent do not appear in the applications list
and can only be managed through a specific option in the <a href="concepts/">Control Center (WIP)</a>.
Their executable files are not stored anywhere and stay in the application's package,
while only their data are stored on the disk. This allows to run the same application
several times without losing any data and without worrying about a data file. This
also allows to store a common data between users.</p>
<p>Note that the store has an option for installing applications as volatile.</p>
<h2 id="commands"><a class="header" href="#commands">Commands</a></h2>
<p>Applications can expose <a href="concepts/">shell commands (WIP)</a>. Multiple commands can be exposed
without any risk of clashing as the name command name must be prefixed by the
AID first.</p>
<p>For instance, if an application with AID <code>developer.app</code> exposes an <code>get_time</code> command,
the final usable command will be <code>developer.app.get_time</code>.</p>
<p>This is quite long name but allows to prevent any clashing between commands. It's
common for shell scripts to use imports at the beginning of the script to refer
more easily to applications' commands.</p>
<p>Note that, by default, shell prompts (not scripts) will allow to directly use
commands such as <code>get_time</code> in the short form if no other application exposes a
command with the same name.</p>
<p>Commands work by launching the application with specific <a href="concepts/">execution context (WIP)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="system-applications"><a class="header" href="#system-applications">System applications</a></h2>
<p>Some [native applications (WIP)] are part of the system itself and are called
<em>system applications</em>. They get a few specific features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to system-reserved features</li>
<li>Ability to create <a href="concepts/">system services (WIP)</a></li>
<li>They cannot be uninstalled</li>
</ul>
<p>System applications cannot be removed in <em>any way</em>, as some of them are critical
for the system to function properly. Native applications which are not system
applications can be removed, though.</p>
<h2 id="services"><a class="header" href="#services">Services</a></h2>
<p>Applications can provide <a href="concepts/">services (WIP)</a> by specifying them in their <a href="concepts/">manifest (WIP)</a>.
The services will be run at startup with the usual application's permissions.</p>
<p>There is exactly one process for each service per active user.</p>

<p>Unlike applications, libraries can be installed in multiple versions.
This means you can have three versions of the same library installed
at the same time on your computer.</p>
<p>When an application wants to use a library, it explicitly indicates
the list of versions it is compatible with. The system gets the
related version and provides it to the application.</p>
<p>A library by itself cannot do itself; no background process, no
commands exposure, no permission granting. Applications simply
use libraries as helpers to achieve specific tasks.</p>

<p>Many computers are intended to be shared by multiple persons.
In such case, it is useful to separate the data of each user
and to prevent other users from accessing another's.</p>
<p>By default, there is two user accounts: the System and the Administrator.
They are called <em>virtual users</em> because it's not possible to log in
these accounts. Other users are called <em>custom users</em>.</p>
<p>Each custom user has a dedicated data directory called <em>homedir</em>, in
<code>/home/[username]</code>, as well as a list of files and directories it
can read and/or write. By default, each user gets access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its homedir in <code>/home/[username]</code></li>
<li>The mounted periphericals in <code>/media</code></li>
<li>Its temporary directory in <code>/tmp/[username]</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="users-type"><a class="header" href="#users-type">Users type</a></h2>
<p>Each user is of a specific type:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Phantom</em>: the user's datas are erased after the computer is turned off</li>
<li><em>Standard</em>: nothing special</li>
<li><em>Administrator</em>: can run programs directly as administrator</li>
<li><em>Main administrator</em>: administrator that can manage storage encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user wants to perform a task it does not have the privileges to,
it can (by default) ask to run the task as <em>another user</em>. The other user's
credentials are then required.</p>
<p>It's not possible to ask to run a task as system or as administrator as these
accounts are virtual and do not have passwords such, <strong>except</strong> if an administrator
user tries to run a task as administrator.</p>
<p>Note that there is always one and exactly one main administrator. The user account
is created during the installation process, and can be transferred later on to
another administrator account.</p>
<h2 id="dangers-of-an-administrator-account"><a class="header" href="#dangers-of-an-administrator-account">Dangers of an administrator account</a></h2>
<p>The problem with administrators account is that <strong>can do almost anything</strong>
(except some very specific things like editing the system's files). They can
change system settings, read and change other users' data, and even run background
processes at startup. They also have all possible privileges as they can edit their
own.</p>
<p>This is why it's extremely discouraged to have two administrator users on the
same computer, unless the two accounts are used by really trustworthy persons.
As such, a large warning is shown if you try to create a new administrator user.</p>
<h2 id="user-privileges-elevation-upe"><a class="header" href="#user-privileges-elevation-upe">User Privileges Elevation (UPE)</a></h2>
<p>Users can ask to perform a task with the privileges of another user, such
as running a program as administrator. This uses the <em>User Privileges Elevation</em>
(UPE) system.</p>
<p>In such case, the program is still run as the current user, but with the
privileges of both the running user and the user specified to the UPE.</p>
<p>Running a program with UPE requires to know either the other account's
password, or to have an <em>authorization</em> from this user. For instance, admin.
users have an <em>authorization</em> to use Administrator account, without providing
any password, although a human confirmation is required.</p>
<p>Each request, successful or not, is logged in the log file at <code>/etc/logs/auc</code>.</p>
<h2 id="groups"><a class="header" href="#groups">Groups</a></h2>
<p><em>Groups</em> are a set of privileges defined by the administrator. Access some folders
or application's permissions (e.g. microphone access) can be restricted to a specific
group, for instance. When a user is created, it can be put in a group. It then
automatically inherits all of the group's privileges, in addition to its own ones.
The administrator can add and remove users from groups with the control panel.</p>
<p>When a user is in a group, the group's privileges cannot be revoked for this user.</p>
